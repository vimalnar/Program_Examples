To create a basic calculator:
  1. Start by taking two numbers from the user.
  2. Ask the user what operation they want to perform: add, subtract, multiply, or divide.
  3. Based on the user's choice, do the following:
     - If the user chooses 'add', add the two numbers.
     - If 'subtract', then subtract the second number from the first.
     - If 'multiply', multiply the two numbers.
     - If 'divide', divide the first number by the second.
  4. Show the result to the user.
  5. Ask if they want to do another calculation. If yes, go back to step 1.

Error Handling:
  - If the user inputs something other than a number in steps 1 and 2, ask them to enter a valid number.
  - In the case of division, if the second number is zero, inform the user that division by zero is not possible and ask for a new number.
  - If the user's choice of operation is not one of the four specified, inform them of the valid options and ask to choose again.
  - If the user wants to exit the program, provide an option to do so at any point.
